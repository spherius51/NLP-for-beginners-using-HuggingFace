# NLP-for-beginners-using-HuggingFace
A beginning project to have a first view about NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is an area that has experienced significant advancements in deep learning over the past few years. The most widely useful application of NLP is classification.

Classification models can also be used to solve problems that are not, at first, obviously appropriate. For instance, consider the Kaggle U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching competition. In this, our task is comparing two words or short phrases, and scoring them based on whether they're similar or not, based on which patent class they were used in. With a score of 1 it is considered that the two inputs have identical meaning, and 0 means they have totally different meaning.

In this notebook, we'll solve the Kaggle U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching problem by considerating it as a classification problem.

This repository contains a Python script for the classification using a training model from the HuggingFace's library.
